## JS 130 - Side Effects Practice Problems ##

1. When `foo` is invoked passing `qux`, there are two side effects: `arr.pop()` will mutate `qux`, and `console.log` will write a string to the console.

2. Functions 2, 3 and 5 are pure functions. None of them have any side effects, and given the same set of arguments, each function will return the same value during its lifetime.
